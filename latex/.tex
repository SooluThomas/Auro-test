\Large \textbf{ABSTRACT}
\vspace{1cm}
\end{center}
Our common understanding of a personal assistant is that of a person (or an agent) who is able to provide distinct help at a given time and in a given activity context. We must be very much familiar with the commercial products such as Appleâ€™s Siri, Googleâ€™s Now and api.aiâ€™s Speak to It Assistant which are the necessary technology inventions (ie., composition of Natural Language Processing, Auto Speech synthesis, Dialogue management and Text-speech Processing) during the past 5 years. The possible application scenario have progressively been changing and now involves domains such as healthCare, weather forecast, navigation, translation, information and tutoring. This personal assistant (AURO) can be used to respond to simple questions and arithmetic calculations.
